                  HISTORIES OF WORST COMPUTER VIRUS ATTACKS:
                  
                  
                  <p>
                  Virus attacks are not shocking news anymore. But here is the list of the worst of those attacks which shocked many at that time in history. The history of computer virus attack is as follow;
                          </p>
                  
                  
                   <p>
                  [1] Jerusalem [1998] - This was the first MS-DOS virus that caused enormous destructions, affecting many countries, universities and company worldwide. On Friday 13, 1988 the computer virus managed to infect a number of institutions in Europe, America and the Middle East.
                               </p>
                  
  <p>                 
[2] Morris [1998] - This computer virus infected over 6,000 computer systems in the United States, including the famous NASA research Institute, which for some time remained completely paralyzed. Due to erratic code, the worm managed to send millions of copies of itself to different network computers, being able to entirely 
 
paralyze all network resources. The damages caused by the Morris computer virus were estimated at $96 million [18].
              </p>

[3] Solar Sunrise [1998] – In 1998 using a computer virus,  hackers, , penetrated and took control of over 500 computers systems that belonged to the army, government and private sector of the United States. The whole situation was dubbed Solar Sunrise after the popular vulnerabilities in computers that run on the operating system called Sun Solaris. It was later allow showing that the incidents represented the work of two American teenagers from California. After the attacks, the Defense Department took drastic actions to prevent future incidents of this kind [27].  
             </p>
      <p>
[4] CIH [1998] - Unleashed from Taiwan in June of 1998, CIH is recognized as one of the most dangerous and destructive virus ever. The virus infected Windows 95, 98, and ME executable files and was able to remain resident in a PC‘s memory, where it continued to infect other executables. What made CIH so dangerous is that, shortly after activated, it would overwrite data on the host PC‘s hard drive. It was also capable of overwriting the BIOS of the host, preventing boot-up. Because it infected executable files, CIH wound up being distributed by numerous software distributors.[28]
                  </p>
          
           <p>
[5] Melissa [1999] - It was created by David L. Smith in 1999 and is based on a Microsoft Word macro. He intended to spread the virus through e-mail messages. The virus prompts the recipient to open a document and by doing so the virus gets activated. The activated virus replicates itself and will be transferred to 50 persons whose address is present in the recipient‘s e-mail address book. The increase in e-mail traffic due to the virus forced some companies to block e-mail a program until the virus attack was controlled.[13]         </p>
               
                <p>
[6] ILOVEYOUILOVEYOU [2000] - It was a standalone program which was capable of replicating itself. The virus initially traveled through the e-mail, same way as Melissa virus. The email had a subject which says that the message was a love letter from the secret admirer. Attachment with this e-mail caused all the trouble. The file LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs contained the worm. As the name suggests Visual Basic Scripting was used for creating this virus. The copied itself several times

and made victim‘s several folders hidden, it added several new files to the victim‘s computer registry keys and replaced several files with copies of itself.[28]         </p> 
                    
                     <p>
[7] Code Red and Code Red II [2001] – It was exploited operating system vulnerability found in Windows 2000 and Windows NT machines. A buffer overflow problem was the vulnerability. Due to this if the operating system receives more information than its buffers handling capacity; the adjacent memory will be overwritten. The original worm initiated a distributed denial of service attack to the White House website. That means all the infected computers with Code Red try to contact the Web servers at the same time, thereby overloading the machines. The infected machine no longer obeys the owner, allowing a remote user to control and access the machine.[11]         </p> 
                          <p>
[8] Nimda [2001] - It was spread through the Internet rapidly and became one of the fastest propagating computer virus. The Nimda worms aimed on the Internet servers and its real purpose was to slow down the Internet traffic. Nimda could travel through the Internet in multiple methods which included the email. The Nimda worm was able to create a backdoor into the victim‘s OS. If the victim was logged in as the administrator for the machine, then the worm would provide the attacker the full control over the system. The Nimda virus caused several network systems to crash as the system‘s resources were taken away by the worm. The Nimda worm was one of the dreaded distributed denials of service (DDoS) attack virus.[30]          </p>
                               <p>
[9] The Klez Virus [2001] – It was appeared in late 2001 and infected a victim‘s computer through an e-mail message. The virus replicated itself and was sent itself to all the contacts in the victim‘s address book. The virus could disable virus-scanning software and could falsely act as a virus-removal tool. The modified version of this virus could take any name from the contact list of the victim and can place that address in the ―From‖ field. This technique is called spoofing. By spoofing the e-mail appears to come from a source when it‘s actually coming from somewhere else. Spoofing will prevent the user‘s chance to block email from a suspected recipient.[27]         </p> 
                                    <p>
[10] SQL Slammer / Sapphire SQL [2003] – It caused a damage of affected networks included Bank of America‘s ATM service, Continental Airlines etc. A few 
    
 minutes after the infection of the first Internet server, the number of victims of the Slammer virus doubled every few seconds. After Fifteen minutes of the first attack, half of the servers that act as the pillars of the Internet were affected by the virus.[14]          </p>
                                         <p>
[11] Sasser and Netsky [2003] - The Sasser worm exploited Microsoft Windows vulnerability. The infected system will look for other vulnerable systems and instruct those systems to download the virus. A random scan of the IP addresses was done to find potential victims. The virus made it difficult to shut down the computer without turning OFF the system. The Netsky virus spread through e-mail and Windows networks. The virus causes a denial of service (DoS) attack on the affected system.[14]        </p>
                                              <p>
[12] Blaster [2003] – The summer of 2003 was a rough time for businesses running PCs. Blaster, also known as Lovsan or MSBlast, was the first to hit. The virus was spread rapidly, peaking in just two days. Transmitted via network and Internet traffic, this worm exploited vulnerability in Windows 2000 and Windows XP, and when activated, presented the PC user with a menacing dialog box indicating that a system shutdown was imminent. Hidden in the code of MSBLAST.EXE — the virus‘ executable‖ were these messages: ―I just want to say LOVE YOU SAN!!‖ and ―billy gates why you make this possible? Stop making money and fix your software!!‖[15]         </p> 
                                                  
                                                   <p>
[13] Sobig.F [2003] – The Sobig worm hit right on the heels of Blaster, making August 2003 a miserable month for corporate and home PC users. The most destructive variant was Sobig.F, which spread so rapidly that it set a record, generating over 1 million copies of itself in its first 24 hours. The virus infected host computers via innocuously named e-mail attachments such as application. When activated, this worm transmitted itself to e-mail addresses discovered on a host of local file types. The end result was massive amounts of Internet traffic.[11]          </p>
                                                   <p>
[14] Bagle [2004] – Bagle, a classic but sophisticated worm, made its debut on January 18, 2004. The malicious code infected users‘ systems via the traditional mechanism — an e-mail attachment — and then scoured Windows files for e-mail addresses it could use to replicate itself. The real danger of Bagle (a.k.a. Beagle) and its 60 to 100 variants is that, when the worm infects a PC, it opens a back door to a TCP port that can be used by remote users and applications to access data —financial, personal, anything — on the infected system. According to an April 2005 TechWeb story, the worm is ―usually credited with starting the malware-for-profit movement among hackers, who prior to the ground-breaking worm, typically were motivated by notoriety.‖ The Bagle.B variant was designed to stop spreading after January 28, 2004, but numerous other variants of the virus continue to plague users to this day.[28]          </p>
     <p>
[15] Sasser [2004] - Sasser began spreading on April 30, 2004, and was destructive enough to shut down the satellite communications for some French news agencies. It also resulted in the cancellation of several Delta airline flights and the shutdown of numerous companies‘ systems worldwide. Unlike most previous worms, Sasser was not transmitted via e-mail and required no user interaction to spread. Instead the worm exploited a security flaw in non-updated Windows 2000 and Windows XP systems. When successfully replicated, the worm would actively scan for other unprotected systems and transmit itself to them. Infected systems experienced repeated crashes and instability.[28]          </p>
         
          <p>
[16] Leap-A/Oompa-A [2004] - Oompa-A was one of the viruses which aimed at Mac systems. The viruses used the iChat instant messaging program for its propagation among vulnerable Mac computers. The Leap-A virus was not able to cause much harm to computers, but showed that even a Mac computer can be affected by malicious software. [16]          </p>
              
               <p>
[17] Storm Worm [2004] - The Storm Worm got this particular name because of the fact that the e-mail messages which carry the virus carried a subject ―230 dead as storm batters Europe.‖ Some versions of this Worm turn computers into bots or Zombies. The infected computers become vulnerable to further attack by the person behind the attack. [14]        </p>
                    <p>
[18] MyDoom [2004] - It was creates a backdoor in the OS of the victim‘s computer. The MyDoom virus had two triggers. One of them began a denial of service (DoS) attack on Feb. 1, 2004. In Feb. 12, 2004 the second trigger was initiated which stopped the virus distributing itself. Later that year, MyDoom virus outbreak occurred for a second time, which targeted several search engine companies. The 

 33 
virus would send a search request to a search engine and will use e-mail addresses obtained in the search results. Such a type of attack slowed down search engine services and caused some website crash. [15]          </p>
                        
                         <p>
                             [19] Downadup [2009]–The latest and most dangerous virus is the “downadup” worm, which was also called “Conficker”. The computer security company F-Secure stated that the computer virus has infected 3.5 million computers worldwide. This malicious program was able to spread using a patched Windows flaw. Downadup was successful in spreading across the Web due to the fact that it used a flaw that Microsoft patched in October in order to distantly compromise computers that ran unmatched versions of Microsoft‘s operating system. But the greatest power of the worm is believed to be the ability of computers, infected with the worm, to download destructive code from a random drop point. F-Secure stated that three of the most affected countries were China, Brazil and Russia.  </p> </div>

<p>              
1.Compiled virus These types of viruses that are compiled into machine executable instructions, so, that they are executed by the Operating System directly. In addition to infecting files, compiled viruses can reside in the memory of infected systems so that each time a new program is executed, the virus infects the program. The Compiled virus typically falls into two categories which are as follow; 
1 File infector virus  2.Boot sector virus   </p>
              <p>
2. File infector virus –  A file infector virus attaches itself to executable programs, such as word processors, spreadsheet applications, and computer games. When the virus has infected a program, it propagates to infect other programs on the system, as well as other systems that use a shared infected program. Once inserted, the malicious code basically 'hijacks' the operating system and subverts its usual behavior, forcing the computer to follow instructions from the virus. A virus that attacks the files on a computer is referred to as a file virus or file infector virus. File viruses number in the thousands, but are not the most widely found in the wild. File viruses have a wide variety of infection techniques and infect a large number of file types 
The most frequent file extensions are com, exe, ovl, bin, sys, bat, obj, prg, menu etc. In all cases, the file viruses act in a similar way. They most often rewrite the beginning of a file where they either write the jump command referring to themselves i.e. virus body, or store themselves to this place. The second case may concern so-called overwriting or destructive viruses. One of their drawbacks is that they destroy or damage the host program. When you try to execute it, the virus is activated, but the program itself is not able to run. We should subdivide file viruses according to the target of infection - they are typically executable files, because the virus's aim is to activate virus through executing host code and therefore the possibility of its spread. The file infector viruses are described in following way; i.e. FILE VIRUS, PROGRAM VIRUS, PARASITIC VIRUSES, BATCH FILE VIRUS, AND DIRECTORY [CLUSTER] VIRUSES  </p>
                   <p>
I) FILE VIRUSES - File viruses are designed to enter your system and infect program and data files. A file virus ordinarily enters the system when you copy data or start your system using an infected floppy disk or, downloads an infected file from a networked system or, use infected software obtained from unauthorized sources. Once in your system, depending upon the virus code, the virus can either infect other program or data files straightway or, it can choose to hide itself in the system memory (RAM) for the time being. Then, at an appropriate time or if certain system conditions are met, it begins to infect other executed program or data files. The virus infects a program or a data file by replacing part of the original file code with a new code. This new code is designed to pass the actual control of the file to the virus. The virus normally attaches itself to the end of the host file. On execution of an infected file by the user, the virus makes sure that the file is executed properly; to avoid suspicion. However, it uses this opportunity to infect other files. At the same time, the virus keeps tabs on the various system resources, so that at an appropriate time (depending upon the virus code), it can unleash its destructive activities. It is interesting to note that most viruses do not infect an already infected file. This is to prevent the file from becoming too large. Because then, the system would be compelled to display the message 'Not enough memory,' thus alerting the user to the possibility of a virus attack. The more sophisticated file viruses save (rather than overwrite) the original instructions when they insert their code into the program. This allows them to execute
the original program after the virus finishes so that everything appears normal. Some file viruses also infect overlay files as well as the more usual *.COM and *.EXE files. Overlay files have various extensions, but .OVR and .OVL are common. Files with the extension .DLL are also capable of being infected. Indeed, as operating systems become more advanced, typically more files become able to contain executable code and thus be vulnerable to infection. Examples of such virus are Vienna, Jerusalem, Concept Word Macro virus, Cascade etc.   </p>
              <p>
II) PROGRAM VIRUSES - Program files are those files which contain coded instructions, necessary to run or execute software programs. These program files are generally appended by .COM or .EXE file extensions. The program files, most prone to file virus attacks include operating software, spreadsheets, word processors, games and utilities program files. [15] These infect executable program files, such as those with extensions like .BIN, .COM, .EXE, .OVL, .DRV (driver) and .SYS (device driver). These programs are loaded in memory during execution, taking the virus with them. The virus becomes active in memory, making copies of it and infecting files on disk. Program viruses attach themselves to executable files such as .exe files. Each time you run the program, the virus duplicates itself and attaches to other programs. Sharing programs with other computers, either by disk or on a network, spreads these types of viruses.  Examples of such virus are Sunday, Cascade, Dec 12-15, Emirates Palace, UAE Register Early to Save  </p>
              <p>
III) PARASITIC VIRUSES – These are pieces of code that attach themselves to executable Files, driver files or compressed files and are activated when the host program is run.  After activation, the virus may spread itself by attaching itself to other program in the system, and also carry out the malevolent activity it was programmed for. Most file viruses spread by loading themselves in system memory and looking for any other by loading themselves in system memory and looking for any other programs located on the drive if it finds one, it modifies the program so that it contains and activates the virus next times it runs .it keeps doing this repeatedly. It is also known as file viruses. 
 
 Besides spreading themselves, these viruses also carry some type of ‗trigger‘. The trigger could be a specific date, or the number of times the viruses has been replicated, or anything equally trivial. Such viruses commonly infect additional programs as they are run, or even just as directory listings are made. But there are many non-resident viruses, too, which simply infect one or more files each time an infected file is run. Amongst traditional EXE and/or COM infectors, these nonresident viruses have not been very ‗successful‘ (in terms of prevalence of infection in the wild).  The operating system on your computer sees the virus as part of the program you were trying to run and gives it the same rights. These rights allow the virus to copy itself, install itself in memory or release its payload. These viruses Infects over networks [14] Examples of such virus are Jerusalem, CIH (Chernobyl), Remote Explorer, Mutant, BootExe, Win95.Murkry, and Lehigh   </p>
              <p>
IV) BATCH FILE VIRUS - This type of virus is embedded into an especially written batch file. The batch file in the guise of carrying out a set of instructions in a particular sequence actually uses the opportunity to copy the virus code to other batch files. Fortunately, such viruses are not common. Batch files can be used to transmit binary executable code and either be or drop viruses. To detect these viruses look for two signs: An odd label at the start of the batch file. And a batch file that is too long for the text in it.  There are several batch file viruses, but each works in a manner similar to that described above. The labels and batch file instructions may differ; but the method of operation is similar. Use the characteristics of the virus described above to look for batch file viruses. If there are obscure labels at the start of a batch file, use caution. Most batch file labels are fairly straight forward words or names. Secondly, if you see a batch file that is several thousand bytes long yet when you use the DOS command TYPE to display it to the screen you only see a few lines, that is another tip-off. Most batch file viruses insert an end-of-file mark (Control-Z) between the batch file portion and the binary instruction portion. Batch file viruses are not common; but like with all things new on your system, take care. [16] Examples of such virus are BAT-Parasite, the Wagner Virus, and The code  
              </p>
              <p>
V) DIRECTORY [CLUSTER] VIRUSES - As the name indicates, a directory virus functions by infecting the directory of your computer.  A directory is simply a larger file that contains information about other files and sub-directories within it.  The general information consists of the file or directory name, the starting cluster, attributes, date and time and so forth.  When a file is accessed, it scans the directory entry in search of the corresponding directory.   These viruses are also called as Cluster Viruses and are programmed to modify the directory table entries in an infected system. The virus, on entering your system, resides in the last cluster of the hard disk. Also, it modifies the starting cluster addresses of all the executable files, by inserting references to the virus address in the File Allocation Table (FAT). The files themselves are not infected, only their starting cluster addresses are altered, so that every time the file is executed, the virus also becomes active and loads into the system memory. The virus allows the actual program to proceed for the time being in order to avoid detection. Also, the virus, when loaded in memory, continues to show the original starting cluster address of the file, so as to confuse the user. Like other viruses, this type of a virus also disrupts the smooth working of your system. Directory viruses change the paths that indicate the location of a file. A directory virus inserts a malicious code into a cluster and marks it as allocated in the FAT. This prevents it from being allocated in the future. The virus then saves the first cluster and forces it to target other clusters, indicating each file it wants to infect.  Examples of such virus are Bulgarian virus, The BHP virus, DIR II, DIR III, DIR BYWAY These are dependent on the particular file type and platform as they are designed keeping in view the way these files execute. To infect a particular file, the virus program should be able to parse it, copy itself into the program and modify the header to get executed, whenever the program is executed. For this to happen, it needs to understand how the various executables are executed in the operating system. Accordingly, there are four (4) subtypes in this category. They are; i) Appending Virus     ii) Overwriting Virus     iii) Cavity Virus iv) Companion Viruses 

i) Appending Virus - This is a type of virus that attaches itself to the end of the host file and modifies the header of the host file so that the control shifts to it on execution. In an appending virus infection, the virus code is appended to the host program and the main entry point of the host program present in the program header is changed to point to the beginning of the virus code. So, when the program executes, the virus is executed first. Then at the end of the virus code, a jump or call routine takes the control back to the start of the host program. Also the new size of the infected host file is updated in the header accordingly.  Examples of such virus are Vienna, Stealth Warrior/The Alliance/SLAM  
ii) Overwriting viruses - Overwriting viruses were initially deployed because of their effectiveness; a way for the infection to infuse itself with an innocent file.  This corrupts the original file in such a way that it can't be disinfected.  Many of them are able to escape the scanner of an Anti-virus program, making no alterations to the victim file so changes aren't detected. While they were very effective, most malicious codes do not write this type of virus anymore. The viruses are very simple and direct in their actions. They overwrite the host program with their own code which devaluates it. That is why they are called overwriting viruses. When calling the host program the viruses need not to be installed to memory at all and they just overwrite some program on the disk by themselves. The program is chosen using some key that is specific for every virus. The program itself becomes worthless and calling it only activates the malefactor and then an error occurs. Examples of such virus are Way, Trj.Reboot, Trivial.88.D  
iii) Cavity Virus - A space fuller (cavity) virus attempts to install itself inside of the file it is infecting. This is difficult but has become easier with new file formats designed to make executable files load and run faster. Cavity virus is one which overwrites a part of the host file that is filled with a constant, without increasing the length of the file, but preserving its functionality.  Not always a virus has to write its body to the beginning or the end of an exe or com file. There are exceptions, fortunately not many, which inserts its body into host file cavities. According to our definition, they are not link viruses, because the infection does not cause file lengthening. Some program files have empty spaces inside them, for a variety of reasons. A Cavity virus uses this empty space to install itself inside the file, without in anyway altering the program itself. Since the 

length of the program is not increased, the virus does not need to employ complex deception techniques. However such viruses are rare. A space filler (cavity) virus, on the other hand, attempts to be clever. Some program files, for a variety of reasons, have empty space inside of them. This empty space can be used to house virus code. Because of the difficulty of writing this type of virus and the limited number of possible hosts, cavity viruses are rare. A cavity virus attempts to install itself inside of the file it is infecting. This is difficult to do properly and so this type of virus is rare. Examples of such virus are The Lehigh virus, CIH virus, or Chernobyl Virus  
iv) Companion Viruses – These viruses create a new file with a different extension, which is composed of the original file and the appended virus. The name of this virus comes from the fact that the virus accompanies the infected file with a companion file. The virus can be given name for example file.com. Every time the user executes file.exe; operating system loads file.com first and therefore infects the system. Although companion viruses do not rank among the most popular viruses, they represent however a real challenge as far as antiviral protection is concerned. Indeed, this infection mode is quite different from the three abovementioned modes. In this mode, the target code is not modified, thus pre serving the code integrity. There in lies the great interest of this infection mode. The viral code identifies a target program and duplicates its own virus code, but instead of inserting its code in the target code, it creates an additional file, which is somehow linked to the target code as far as execution is concerned. Whenever the user executes a target program which has been infected by this type of virus, the viral copy contained in the additional file is executed first, thus enabling the virus to spread using the same mechanism. Then, the virus calls the original, legitimate target program which is then executed.[14] Examples of such virus are Stator, Asimov.1539, and Terrax.1069</p>
              <p>
2.Boot sector Viruses-  Boot sector viruses infect the executable code stored in certain parts of system region on the disk. It can concern floppy disk boot sectors, hard disk partition table or hard disk boot sector. The sector is where your computer starts reading your operating system. This is a crucial part of a disk, in which information on the disk itself is stored together with a program that makes it possible to start the computer from the disk. One important trick was the ability to load viruses into memory so they could  
keep running in the background as long as the computer remained on. This gave viruses a much more effective way to replicate themselves. Another trick was the ability to infect the boot sector on floppy disks and hard disks. The boot sector is a small program that is the first part of the operating system that the computer loads. The boot sector contains a tiny program that tells the computer how to load the rest of the operating system. By putting its code in the boot sector, a virus can guarantee it gets executed. [15] Boot sector exists on every floppy disk that has been formatted using MSDOS, no matter if this floppy disk is a system disk or data disk. Boot sector contains a short program that uses DOS for executing the system before passing control to other system programs or command compiler. There are very important instructions in the boot sectors that load operating system to the main memory on every startup, therefore it is enough if the virus or its activating mechanism is stored in this sector, and the virus will be loaded to main memory with every boot up. Mentioned viruses usually rewrite the boot sector with their own code and the original parts of the boot sector save on different part of disk. The infection then spreads using floppy disk boot sectors that got in touch with the infected system and that the resident boot virus replicates into immediately. The spread of boot sector viruses in 32bit systems is much more difficult than in DOS because a boot sector virus is detected right away on the system boot. Infects the boot sector or the master boot record, or displaces the active boot sector, of a hard drive. Once the hard drive is booted up, boot sector viruses load them selves into the computer‘s memory [15].   In effect, the virus takes full control of the infected computer. A boot sector virus, like other viruses, enters the system when you copy data or start your system using an infected floppy disk or, downloads an infected file from a networked system or, use infected software obtained from unauthorized sources. This is true even of disks that do not hold a bootable operating system. This boot sector is the very first sector of the logical drive and contains specific information relating to the formatting of the disk, the data stored there and on PCs is expected to contain a small program called the boot program. Boot programs are expected to load the appropriate operating system files when an attempt is made to boot from a disk, and typically display the familiar "Non-system Disk or Disk Error" message if the operating system files are not present. It is increasingly common for the boot program on diskettes to simply display a message warning that the diskette does not contain a bootable system – such boot programs will be overwritten with an 

appropriate one should you reformat the diskette using an option that copies operating system files to the disk.  Examples of such virus are Polyboot.B, AntiEXE, Joshi and Michelangelo, Form, Disk Killer, and Stone virus

3.Interpreted virus An interpreted virus is composed of source code that can be executed only by a particular application or service. Interpreted viruses have become very common because they are much easier to write and modify than other types of viruses. The viruses are classified in to two main categories which are as follow; i. Macro Virus ii. Script Virus i. Macro Virus  A macro virus is a virus that attaches itself to a spreadsheet worksheet, or is programmed into the spreadsheet. Written in the macro scripting languages of word processing, accounting, editing, or project applications, it propagates by exploiting the macro language‘s properties in order to transfer itself from the infected file containing the macro script to another file. The most widespread macro viruses are for Microsoft Office applications like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Access. Because they are written in the code of application Software, macro viruses are platform independent and can spread between Mac, Windows, Linux, and any other system running the targeted application. [16] These mini-programs make it possible to automate series of operations so that they are performed as a single action, thereby saving the user from having to carry them out one by one. In addition, when a macro virus infection occurs, the virus infects the template that the program uses to create and open files. Once a template is infected, every document that is created or opened with that template is also infected. Any document on that machine that uses the same application can then become infected. If the infected computer is on a network, the infection is likely to spread rapidly to other machines on the network. Moreover, if a copy of an infected file is passed to anyone else i.e. by email or floppy disk, the virus can spread to the recipient‘s computer. This process of infection will end only when the virus is noticed and all viral macros are eradicated. 

The most popular and most widespread macro language is VBA and this is very easy to write programs in, be they viruses or not. This is, of course, part of the reason why VBA viruses became very common – many people who could not otherwise write a virus have been able to write a VBA macro virus. This also adds to its threat as a virus development platform because the term ‗application macro‘ suggests to many users and administrators the keystroke recording type of ‗macro‘ common in earlier and less powerful applications. If ‗macro‘ means ‗keystroke recording‘ to someone, they are unlikely to imagine much of a threat being possible in a ‗macro virus‘.  Examples of such virus are DMV, Nuclear, Word Concept, WM/Wazzu, OF97/Crown-B, Corel Script, CSC/CSV.A, Relax, Melissa.A and Bablas. Pc, W97M.Melissa, WM.NiceDay, W97M.Groov .EXE or .VBS   
ii. Scripting viruses   Scripting viruses are a subset of file viruses, written in one of a variety of script languages (Visual Basic Script, JavaScript, Windows Batch, etc.). Either infects other scripts, e.g., Windows command and service files, or forms a part of a multi-component virus. Script viruses are able to infect other file formats, such as Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), if that file format allows the execution of scripts. These are very similar to macro viruses. The primary difference is that a macro virus is written in a language understood by a particular application, such as a word processor, whereas a scripting virus is written in a language understood by a service run by the OS. [16]  Viruses that infect various scripting languages, from the most basic (DOS batch) through to the sophisticated JavaScript (JS) and Visual Basic Script (VBS), are also a form of file infector. DOS batch viruses have always been of interest value only, never posing a serious threat due to the rather limited nature of the language itself. However, the increased complexity of the JS and VBS languages hosted under the Windows Scripting Host (WSH) certainly increased the attractiveness of script file infectors. The integration of the scripting engine with many standard OS functions such as file system, networking and registry interfaces opened up a whole slew of opportunities – much like VBA macro viruses, these scripting languages have allowed ‗non-programmers‘ to become virus writers.  

Examples of such virus are JS.Fortnight, Browser exploit, Spoon, Samy Worm, XSS Viruses, JS.Fortnight  </p>
              <p>
4.Multipartite viruses  Multipartite viruses are distributed through infected media and usually hide in the memory. Multipartite viruses affect executable files, disk boot sectors and sometimes also floppy disks sectors. Their name comes from the fact that they do not restrict to any specific disk region or any specific file type, but infect computers in several ways. If you execute any application affected by the multipartite virus, the virus infects the boot sector of your machine. The virus is activated on the next system load and infects any suitable program that you execute. Before the rise of macro viruses, several of the most common file infectors were actually the file infector parts of multi-partite viruses that had leveraged the distribution advantage attributable to their boot infector components. These viruses became common because of their boot virus components. More recently we have seen complex forms of multi-parties with, for example, viruses that infect EXE files and insert droppers as macros in suitable document files.  These is no difference between multipartite virus and non multipartite virus, Because all parts of these viruses depend on the Visual Basic for Applications macro platform, these viruses are usually not considered as infecting more than one target type. Such viruses are sometimes referred to as cross-platform viruses, but that is also contentious as the platform is essentially the same. Such viruses that work ‗between‘ office applications are often called cross-infectors or crossapplication-infectors which are a suitable term. Multi-partite viruses are rare, although in the past the file infectors most commonly seen in the wild were the file infecting components of file and boot multi-parties. Examples of such virus are Natas, Invader, Flip, and Tequila, Invader, Flip, and Tequila, Ywinz </p>
              <p>
5.Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) virus The RFID worm infection process begins when hackers first discover RFID middleware servers to infect over the Internet. An RFID worm propagates by exploiting security flaws in online RFID services. RFID worms do not necessarily require users to do anything to propagate, although they will also happily spread via 
 
RFID tags. A type of theoretical virus that is expected to target RFID devices. So far, such viruses have only been demonstrated by researchers. A completely different category of threats arises when hackers or criminals cause valid RFID tags to behave in unexpected ways. Typically, computer-bound or mobile RFID readers query RFID tags for their unique identifier or on-tag data, which often serves as a database key or launches some real-world activity.  Everyone working on RFID technology has tacitly assumed that the mere act of scanning an RFID tag cannot modify back-end software, and certainly not in a malicious way. An RFID tag can be intentionally infected with a virus and this virus can infect the backend database used by the RFID software. From there it can be easily spread to other RFID tags. No one thought this possible until now. Later in this website we provide all the details on how to do this and how to defend against it in order to warn the designers of RFID systems not to deploy vulnerable systems. 
              Examples of such virus are SQL Injector etc

*) Network Worms It is a Self-propagating program that spreads over a network, usually the Internet. Unlike viruses, may not depend on other programs or victim actions for replication, dissemination, or execution for example opening an infected email attachment or clicking on the Web link for a malware Web site. Worms spread by locating other vulnerable potential hosts on the network, then copying their program instructions to those hosts. Worms have traditionally been categorized according to their dissemination medium. More recently, however, they have begun to be categorized according to their propagation speed. [23] This kind of virus is proficient in quickly spreading across a Local Area Network (LAN) or even over the Internet. Usually, it propagates through shared resources, such as shared drives and folders. Once it infects a new system, it searches for potential targets by searching the network for other vulnerable systems. Once a new vulnerable system is found, the network virus infects the other system, and thus spreads over the network. Mobiles are affected mostly due to Network virus, because of increasing use of Bluetooth, infrared and internet. Network worms got into mainstream only with emergence of high speed network including cable-modems and large corporate networks with many often unpacked PCs.  Network worm are more difficult to disinfect as infections are often distributed among multiple sites and expose gross blunders in design of the network and/or configuration of desktops. Network worms are probably the most complex type of worms to fight and they often cause considerable panic in corporate environments. Unfortunately this if often done after the initial splash of activity of the worm after which it is just sitting more or less quietly on infected computers. Automatic tools like automatic disinfection are usually not very effective against such threat as new successful network worm is usually successful exactly because it  
invents a completely new attack vector. Detection based on traffic anomalies can detect the initial attack but due to the chain reaction character of infections this detection is pretty much useless. Still it is important to have. [24]    Examples of such virus are Nimda and SQLSlammer, Code Red, MSBlaster, Sasser, Zotob, Allaple.B  These are Six (6) types of network worms are listed and discussed bellow;
                        1. E-Mail Worm 
                        2. Instance Messaging Worm
                        3. Internet Worm 
                        4. File sharing and peer-to-peer worm 
                        5. flash worm 
                        6. Hoaxes </p><p>
                       1 E-Mail Worm: As you might expect, an e-mail worm spreads by using an e-mail message as the delivery vehicle. Sometimes, the worm‘s main executable file may be included as an infected attachment to the e-mail, or it may be embedded as an object or script in the e-mail message. Once the e-mail worm has installed itself on the computer, it will typically use the infected system‘s local e-mail client to send out copies of the worm to other victims. Often, the people that the worm sends its copies to are those whose e-mail addresses are saved on the infected computer, in a data file or in the local e-mail client. Many of the most prolific viruses are email-aware: they distribute themselves automatically by email. Email viruses may compromise your computer‘s security or steal data, but their most common effect is to create excessive email traffic and crash servers. Email can be used to transmit any of the above types of virus by copying and emailing itself to every address in the victim‘s email address book, usually within an email attachment. Each time a recipient opens the infected attachment, the virus harvests that victim‘s email address book and repeats its propagation process. [14]  Often, these infected e-mails are sent to e-mail addresses that the worm harvests from files on an infected computer. Email-Worms, also known as massmailer worms, are one of the most common types of worms today. The first few email worm outbreaks were caused by worms that propagated rapidly, sending millions of copies over networks worldwide. These pandemics essentially clogged up the network resources of affected companies until the infected computers could 
 
be taken offline and cleaned. The resulting disruptions in communications affected millions of users and reportedly led to millions of dollars in losses for affected businesses.  Examples of such virus are Love Bug/ILOVEYOU (.VBS), MYDOOM, SOBIG, Good Times (hoax), Melissa, .BAT, .COM, .EXE, .SCR, .PIF and .SHS  </p>
                 <p>     
2.Instance Messaging Worm: Similar to an e-mail worm, an IM-Worm uses instant messaging applications installed on the infected machine to send a message to everyone listed on the contact list. The message will usually contain a link to a site that will infect users who visit it. More rarely, the message may also include an infectious attachment. Instant Messaging is becoming a very popular form of communication both for personal use and business use. Due to the popularity and convenience of Instant Messaging applications, many platforms for using this type of application have become available for PCs and mobile devices. While this is convenient for the users of IM, it also increases the possibilities for malicious attacks and security breaches.  Spread via infected attachments to IM messages or reader access to Uniform Resource Locators (URL) in messages that point to malicious IM Web sites from which the worm is downloaded. Like email viruses, instant message viruses are malicious programs that are designed to travel through IM. These viruses are spread, in most cases, when a person clicks a link or opens an infected file that was sent in an instant message that appeared to come from a friend. When you open one of these files, your computer can become infected with a virus. Because of the virus, your computer may slow down or stop responding, or you may not notice any change at all. IM worms can let an attacker hijack and send messages with infected attachments or phishing-related hyperlinks from victims' clients to their IM contacts. This could make the contacts believe the communications came from an acquaintance and that opening attachments or clicking on hyperlinks is safe.  Examples of such virus are Assiral.A, Bizex. Bropia., Kelvir and Serflog, Gabby.a., Kelvir.   </p><p>
3.Internet Worm Internet-worms can transmit themselves from a remote location on the Internet directly onto a computer. These worms are designed to exploit vulnerability in a 
computer system that allows them to gain entry. To find their victims, these worms scan the Internet for vulnerable machines. Once found, the worm can then simply download itself onto the computer, and then continue finding and infecting other victims. In contrast to an Internet-worm, a Net-worm copies itself to other computers connected to the first, infected machine by a local area network (LAN). One common tactic used by Net-worms is to put copies of itself onto any accessible network share - a media such as a hard drive or server that can be accessed by other users on the same network. Home networks, businesses and even major corporations will have a few open shares, which make it significantly easier for the worm to infect other users on the network. [11] It is also call as web worms which are spread via user access to a Web page, File Transfer Protocol site, or other Internet resource. Internet worms are truly autonomous virtual viruses, spreading across the net, breaking into computers, and replicating without human assistance and usually without human knowledge. An Internet worm can be contained in any kind of virus, program or script. Worms use a variety of methods to propagate across the Internet. The worm performed the trick by combining a bug in the debugging mode of the send mail program used to control email on almost all Internet computers.  Examples of such virus are PSWBugbear.B, Lovgate.F, Trile.C, Sobig.D, and Mapson.  </p><p>
4 File sharing and peer-to-peer worm Internet worms that use P2P vulnerabilities to propagate themselves in the network are called P2P worms. In fact we use the term worm and malware interchangeable in this work, as both are in the scope of our work. Worms propagate quickly on the Internet in a short period of time. Although many different categorization of worm proposed in the literature, here we categorize worms into two general groups of scanning and non-scanning. Scanning worms probe addresses to find new victims; also traffic pattern that they create is distinguishable from the normal traffic seen on the net. They could be further divided on three sub categories of random scanning, hit list scanning and permutation scanning worms. But nonscanning worms select vulnerable nodes from information available to them and they do not waste any time in probing address space for vulnerable hosts, so their probability of success in infecting vulnerable hosts is higher than scanning worms.  

An alternative way to divide worms is in two subgroups of active and passive worms. Active worms do not require human intervention and transfer from a computer to another automatically. Alternatively, and unlike active worms, passive worms hide themselves within other files, and propagate as the file is copied to new hosts. In the context of P2P networks, the worm copies itself with multiple file names into the share directory of the infected host; thereby increasing the chance of being downloaded by the next victim which is now available in multiple file names. When the file is downloaded by the next victim this process is repeated. Unlike the active worms which create anomalous network traffic as they try to propagate themselves, passive worms are quite stealth and are hidden within the normal peer exchanges. After the entire peer is downloading a file he/she was looking for, unaware that the file is infected, and such exchange does not look suspicious. Examples of such virus are P2P-Worm.Win32.Mandragoere, P2PWorm.W32.Nugg, P2P- worm.win32.polip.a  </p><p>
5 Flash worm: It a full list of vulnerable hosts and that could possibly infect the whole vulnerable population in a few seconds. Flash worms follow a recomputed spread tree using prior knowledge of all systems vulnerable to the worm‘s exploit. Flash worms are the fastest possible worms and so may be created someday by worm writers needing to control a vulnerable population with extreme speed Because of the off-line nature of the spread map computation, flash worms are a useful thought experiment for exploring the worst case performance of containment defenses. The spread map can be adjusted to be whatever will be most difficult for the defense, and then the worm made as efficient as possible given that constraint. Flash worm is supposed to have the list of all the possible targets prepared in advance so that no scan during the worm spreading time is necessary. Creation of such a worm requires considerable preparation efforts. Thus, the whole Internet has to be scanned in some way and the list of best initial targets is constructed. While this preparation procedure is quite expensive it can easily be accomplished by a government scale organization by a brute force scanning via a fast Internet link. This method, however, has a big limitation. Hosts behind firewalls cannot be scanned effectively. Examples of such Flash worm are Stumble

                  HISTORIES OF WORST COMPUTER VIRUS ATTACKS:
                  
                  
                  <p>
                  Virus attacks are not shocking news anymore. But here is the list of the worst of those attacks which shocked many at that time in history. The history of computer virus attack is as follow;
                          </p>
                  
                  
                   <p>
                  [1] Jerusalem [1998] - This was the first MS-DOS virus that caused enormous destructions, affecting many countries, universities and company worldwide. On Friday 13, 1988 the computer virus managed to infect a number of institutions in Europe, America and the Middle East.
                               </p>
                  
  <p>                 
[2] Morris [1998] - This computer virus infected over 6,000 computer systems in the United States, including the famous NASA research Institute, which for some time remained completely paralyzed. Due to erratic code, the worm managed to send millions of copies of itself to different network computers, being able to entirely 
 
paralyze all network resources. The damages caused by the Morris computer virus were estimated at $96 million [18].
              </p>
      
      
      
      
 <p>
[3] Solar Sunrise [1998] â€“ In 1998 using a computer virus,  hackers, , penetrated and took control of over 500 computers systems that belonged to the army, government and private sector of the United States. The whole situation was dubbed Solar Sunrise after the popular vulnerabilities in computers that run on the operating system called Sun Solaris. It was later allow showing that the incidents represented the work of two American teenagers from California. After the attacks, the Defense Department took drastic actions to prevent future incidents of this kind [27].  
             </p>
      <p>
[4] CIH [1998] - Unleashed from Taiwan in June of 1998, CIH is recognized as one of the most dangerous and destructive virus ever. The virus infected Windows 95, 98, and ME executable files and was able to remain resident in a PCâ€˜s memory, where it continued to infect other executables. What made CIH so dangerous is that, shortly after activated, it would overwrite data on the host PCâ€˜s hard drive. It was also capable of overwriting the BIOS of the host, preventing boot-up. Because it infected executable files, CIH wound up being distributed by numerous software distributors.[28]
                  </p>
          
           <p>
[5] Melissa [1999] - It was created by David L. Smith in 1999 and is based on a Microsoft Word macro. He intended to spread the virus through e-mail messages. The virus prompts the recipient to open a document and by doing so the virus gets activated. The activated virus replicates itself and will be transferred to 50 persons whose address is present in the recipientâ€˜s e-mail address book. The increase in e-mail traffic due to the virus forced some companies to block e-mail a program until the virus attack was controlled.[13]         </p>
               
                <p>
[6] ILOVEYOUILOVEYOU [2000] - It was a standalone program which was capable of replicating itself. The virus initially traveled through the e-mail, same way as Melissa virus. The email had a subject which says that the message was a love letter from the secret admirer. Attachment with this e-mail caused all the trouble. The file LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs contained the worm. As the name suggests Visual Basic Scripting was used for creating this virus. The copied itself several times 
CHAPTER â€“ II

and made victimâ€˜s several folders hidden, it added several new files to the victimâ€˜s computer registry keys and replaced several files with copies of itself.[28]         </p> 
                    
                     <p>
[7] Code Red and Code Red II [2001] â€“ It was exploited operating system vulnerability found in Windows 2000 and Windows NT machines. A buffer overflow problem was the vulnerability. Due to this if the operating system receives more information than its buffers handling capacity; the adjacent memory will be overwritten. The original worm initiated a distributed denial of service attack to the White House website. That means all the infected computers with Code Red try to contact the Web servers at the same time, thereby overloading the machines. The infected machine no longer obeys the owner, allowing a remote user to control and access the machine.[11]         </p> 
                          <p>
[8] Nimda [2001] - It was spread through the Internet rapidly and became one of the fastest propagating computer virus. The Nimda worms aimed on the Internet servers and its real purpose was to slow down the Internet traffic. Nimda could travel through the Internet in multiple methods which included the email. The Nimda worm was able to create a backdoor into the victimâ€˜s OS. If the victim was logged in as the administrator for the machine, then the worm would provide the attacker the full control over the system. The Nimda virus caused several network systems to crash as the systemâ€˜s resources were taken away by the worm. The Nimda worm was one of the dreaded distributed denials of service (DDoS) attack virus.[30]          </p>
                               <p>
[9] The Klez Virus [2001] â€“ It was appeared in late 2001 and infected a victimâ€˜s computer through an e-mail message. The virus replicated itself and was sent itself to all the contacts in the victimâ€˜s address book. The virus could disable virus-scanning software and could falsely act as a virus-removal tool. The modified version of this virus could take any name from the contact list of the victim and can place that address in the â€•Fromâ€– field. This technique is called spoofing. By spoofing the e-mail appears to come from a source when itâ€˜s actually coming from somewhere else. Spoofing will prevent the userâ€˜s chance to block email from a suspected recipient.[27]         </p> 
                                    <p>
[10] SQL Slammer / Sapphire SQL [2003] â€“ It caused a damage of affected networks included Bank of Americaâ€˜s ATM service, Continental Airlines etc. A few 
    
 minutes after the infection of the first Internet server, the number of victims of the Slammer virus doubled every few seconds. After Fifteen minutes of the first attack, half of the servers that act as the pillars of the Internet were affected by the virus.[14]          </p>
                                         <p>
[11] Sasser and Netsky [2003] - The Sasser worm exploited Microsoft Windows vulnerability. The infected system will look for other vulnerable systems and instruct those systems to download the virus. A random scan of the IP addresses was done to find potential victims. The virus made it difficult to shut down the computer without turning OFF the system. The Netsky virus spread through e-mail and Windows networks. The virus causes a denial of service (DoS) attack on the affected system.[14]        </p>
                                              <p>
[12] Blaster [2003] â€“ The summer of 2003 was a rough time for businesses running PCs. Blaster, also known as Lovsan or MSBlast, was the first to hit. The virus was spread rapidly, peaking in just two days. Transmitted via network and Internet traffic, this worm exploited vulnerability in Windows 2000 and Windows XP, and when activated, presented the PC user with a menacing dialog box indicating that a system shutdown was imminent. Hidden in the code of MSBLAST.EXE â€” the virusâ€˜ executableâ€– were these messages: â€•I just want to say LOVE YOU SAN!!â€– and â€•billy gates why you make this possible? Stop making money and fix your software!!â€–[15]         </p> 
                                                  
                                                   <p>
[13] Sobig.F [2003] â€“ The Sobig worm hit right on the heels of Blaster, making August 2003 a miserable month for corporate and home PC users. The most destructive variant was Sobig.F, which spread so rapidly that it set a record, generating over 1 million copies of itself in its first 24 hours. The virus infected host computers via innocuously named e-mail attachments such as application. When activated, this worm transmitted itself to e-mail addresses discovered on a host of local file types. The end result was massive amounts of Internet traffic.[11]          </p>
                                                   <p>
[14] Bagle [2004] â€“ Bagle, a classic but sophisticated worm, made its debut on January 18, 2004. The malicious code infected usersâ€˜ systems via the traditional mechanism â€” an e-mail attachment â€” and then scoured Windows files for e-mail addresses it could use to replicate itself. The real danger of Bagle (a.k.a. Beagle) and its 60 to 100 variants is that, when the worm infects a PC, it opens a back door to a TCP port that can be used by remote users and applications to access data â€”financial, personal, anything â€” on the infected system. According to an April 2005 TechWeb story, the worm is â€•usually credited with starting the malware-for-profit movement among hackers, who prior to the ground-breaking worm, typically were motivated by notoriety.â€– The Bagle.B variant was designed to stop spreading after January 28, 2004, but numerous other variants of the virus continue to plague users to this day.[28]          </p>
     <p>
[15] Sasser [2004] - Sasser began spreading on April 30, 2004, and was destructive enough to shut down the satellite communications for some French news agencies. It also resulted in the cancellation of several Delta airline flights and the shutdown of numerous companiesâ€˜ systems worldwide. Unlike most previous worms, Sasser was not transmitted via e-mail and required no user interaction to spread. Instead the worm exploited a security flaw in non-updated Windows 2000 and Windows XP systems. When successfully replicated, the worm would actively scan for other unprotected systems and transmit itself to them. Infected systems experienced repeated crashes and instability.[28]          </p>
         
          <p>
[16] Leap-A/Oompa-A [2004] - Oompa-A was one of the viruses which aimed at Mac systems. The viruses used the iChat instant messaging program for its propagation among vulnerable Mac computers. The Leap-A virus was not able to cause much harm to computers, but showed that even a Mac computer can be affected by malicious software. [16]          </p>
              
               <p>
[17] Storm Worm [2004] - The Storm Worm got this particular name because of the fact that the e-mail messages which carry the virus carried a subject â€•230 dead as storm batters Europe.â€– Some versions of this Worm turn computers into bots or Zombies. The infected computers become vulnerable to further attack by the person behind the attack. [14]        </p>
                    <p>
[18] MyDoom [2004] - It was creates a backdoor in the OS of the victimâ€˜s computer. The MyDoom virus had two triggers. One of them began a denial of service (DoS) attack on Feb. 1, 2004. In Feb. 12, 2004 the second trigger was initiated which stopped the virus distributing itself. Later that year, MyDoom virus outbreak occurred for a second time, which targeted several search engine companies. The 

 33 
virus would send a search request to a search engine and will use e-mail addresses obtained in the search results. Such a type of attack slowed down search engine services and caused some website crash. [15]          </p>
                        
                         <p>
                                  [19] Downadup [2009]â€“The latest and most dangerous virus is the â€œdownadupâ€� worm, which was also called â€œConfickerâ€�. The computer security company F-Secure stated that the computer virus has infected 3.5 million computers worldwide. This malicious program was able to spread using a patched Windows flaw. Downadup was successful in spreading across the Web due to the fact that it used a flaw that Microsoft patched in October in order to distantly compromise computers that ran unmatched versions of Microsoftâ€˜s operating system. But the greatest power of the worm is believed to be the ability of computers, infected with the worm, to download destructive code from a random drop point. F-Secure stated that three of the most affected countries were China, Brazil and Russia.  </p> </div>

*) Network Worms It is a Self-propagating program that spreads over a network, usually the Internet. Unlike viruses, may not depend on other programs or victim actions for replication, dissemination, or execution for example opening an infected email attachment or clicking on the Web link for a malware Web site. Worms spread by locating other vulnerable potential hosts on the network, then copying their program instructions to those hosts. Worms have traditionally been categorized according to their dissemination medium. More recently, however, they have begun to be categorized according to their propagation speed. [23] This kind of virus is proficient in quickly spreading across a Local Area Network (LAN) or even over the Internet. Usually, it propagates through shared resources, such as shared drives and folders. Once it infects a new system, it searches for potential targets by searching the network for other vulnerable systems. Once a new vulnerable system is found, the network virus infects the other system, and thus spreads over the network. Mobiles are affected mostly due to Network virus, because of increasing use of Bluetooth, infrared and internet. Network worms got into mainstream only with emergence of high speed network including cable-modems and large corporate networks with many often unpacked PCs.  Network worm are more difficult to disinfect as infections are often distributed among multiple sites and expose gross blunders in design of the network and/or configuration of desktops. Network worms are probably the most complex type of worms to fight and they often cause considerable panic in corporate environments. Unfortunately this if often done after the initial splash of activity of the worm after which it is just sitting more or less quietly on infected computers. Automatic tools like automatic disinfection are usually not very effective against such threat as new successful network worm is usually successful exactly because it  
invents a completely new attack vector. Detection based on traffic anomalies can detect the initial attack but due to the chain reaction character of infections this detection is pretty much useless. Still it is important to have. [24]    Examples of such virus are Nimda and SQLSlammer, Code Red, MSBlaster, Sasser, Zotob, Allaple.B  These are Six (6) types of network worms are listed and discussed bellow;
                        1. E-Mail Worm 
                        2. Instance Messaging Worm
                        3. Internet Worm 
                        4. File sharing and peer-to-peer worm

                       1 E-Mail Worm: As you might expect, an e-mail worm spreads by using an e-mail message as the delivery vehicle. Sometimes, the wormâ€˜s main executable file may be included as an infected attachment to the e-mail, or it may be embedded as an object or script in the e-mail message. Once the e-mail worm has installed itself on the computer, it will typically use the infected systemâ€˜s local e-mail client to send out copies of the worm to other victims. Often, the people that the worm sends its copies to are those whose e-mail addresses are saved on the infected computer, in a data file or in the local e-mail client. Many of the most prolific viruses are email-aware: they distribute themselves automatically by email. Email viruses may compromise your computerâ€˜s security or steal data, but their most common effect is to create excessive email traffic and crash servers. Email can be used to transmit any of the above types of virus by copying and emailing itself to every address in the victimâ€˜s email address book, usually within an email attachment. Each time a recipient opens the infected attachment, the virus harvests that victimâ€˜s email address book and repeats its propagation process. [14]  Often, these infected e-mails are sent to e-mail addresses that the worm harvests from files on an infected computer. Email-Worms, also known as massmailer worms, are one of the most common types of worms today. The first few email worm outbreaks were caused by worms that propagated rapidly, sending millions of copies over networks worldwide. These pandemics essentially clogged up the network resources of affected companies until the infected computers could 
 
be taken offline and cleaned. The resulting disruptions in communications affected millions of users and reportedly led to millions of dollars in losses for affected businesses.  Examples of such virus are Love Bug/ILOVEYOU (.VBS), MYDOOM, SOBIG, Good Times (hoax), Melissa, .BAT, .COM, .EXE, .SCR, .PIF and .SHS  </p>

2.Instance Messaging Worm: Similar to an e-mail worm, an IM-Worm uses instant messaging applications installed on the infected machine to send a message to everyone listed on the contact list. The message will usually contain a link to a site that will infect users who visit it. More rarely, the message may also include an infectious attachment. Instant Messaging is becoming a very popular form of communication both for personal use and business use. Due to the popularity and convenience of Instant Messaging applications, many platforms for using this type of application have become available for PCs and mobile devices. While this is convenient for the users of IM, it also increases the possibilities for malicious attacks and security breaches.  Spread via infected attachments to IM messages or reader access to Uniform Resource Locators (URL) in messages that point to malicious IM Web sites from which the worm is downloaded. Like email viruses, instant message viruses are malicious programs that are designed to travel through IM. These viruses are spread, in most cases, when a person clicks a link or opens an infected file that was sent in an instant message that appeared to come from a friend. When you open one of these files, your computer can become infected with a virus. Because of the virus, your computer may slow down or stop responding, or you may not notice any change at all. IM worms can let an attacker hijack and send messages with infected attachments or phishing-related hyperlinks from victims' clients to their IM contacts. This could make the contacts believe the communications came from an acquaintance and that opening attachments or clicking on hyperlinks is safe.  Examples of such virus are Assiral.A, Bizex. Bropia., Kelvir and Serflog, Gabby.a., Kelvir.   </p><p>
3.Internet Worm Internet-worms can transmit themselves from a remote location on the Internet directly onto a computer. These worms are designed to exploit vulnerability in a 
computer system that allows them to gain entry. To find their victims, these worms scan the Internet for vulnerable machines. Once found, the worm can then simply download itself onto the computer, and then continue finding and infecting other victims. In contrast to an Internet-worm, a Net-worm copies itself to other computers connected to the first, infected machine by a local area network (LAN). One common tactic used by Net-worms is to put copies of itself onto any accessible network share - a media such as a hard drive or server that can be accessed by other users on the same network. Home networks, businesses and even major corporations will have a few open shares, which make it significantly easier for the worm to infect other users on the network. [11] It is also call as web worms which are spread via user access to a Web page, File Transfer Protocol site, or other Internet resource. Internet worms are truly autonomous virtual viruses, spreading across the net, breaking into computers, and replicating without human assistance and usually without human knowledge. An Internet worm can be contained in any kind of virus, program or script. Worms use a variety of methods to propagate across the Internet. The worm performed the trick by combining a bug in the debugging mode of the send mail program used to control email on almost all Internet computers.  Examples of such virus are PSWBugbear.B, Lovgate.F, Trile.C, Sobig.D, and Mapson.  </p><p>
4 File sharing and peer-to-peer worm Internet worms that use P2P vulnerabilities to propagate themselves in the network are called P2P worms. In fact we use the term worm and malware interchangeable in this work, as both are in the scope of our work. Worms propagate quickly on the Internet in a short period of time. Although many different categorization of worm proposed in the literature, here we categorize worms into two general groups of scanning and non-scanning. Scanning worms probe addresses to find new victims; also traffic pattern that they create is distinguishable from the normal traffic seen on the net. They could be further divided on three sub categories of random scanning, hit list scanning and permutation scanning worms. But nonscanning worms select vulnerable nodes from information available to them and they do not waste any time in probing address space for vulnerable hosts, so their probability of success in infecting vulnerable hosts is higher than scanning worms.  

An alternative way to divide worms is in two subgroups of active and passive worms. Active worms do not require human intervention and transfer from a computer to another automatically. Alternatively, and unlike active worms, passive worms hide themselves within other files, and propagate as the file is copied to new hosts. In the context of P2P networks, the worm copies itself with multiple file names into the share directory of the infected host; thereby increasing the chance of being downloaded by the next victim which is now available in multiple file names. When the file is downloaded by the next victim this process is repeated. Unlike the active worms which create anomalous network traffic as they try to propagate themselves, passive worms are quite stealth and are hidden within the normal peer exchanges. After the entire peer is downloading a file he/she was looking for, unaware that the file is infected, and such exchange does not look suspicious. Examples of such virus are P2P-Worm.Win32.Mandragoere, P2PWorm.W32.Nugg, P2P- worm.win32.polip.a  </p><p>
5 Flash worm: It a full list of vulnerable hosts and that could possibly infect the whole vulnerable population in a few seconds. Flash worms follow a recomputed spread tree using prior knowledge of all systems vulnerable to the wormâ€˜s exploit. Flash worms are the fastest possible worms and so may be created someday by worm writers needing to control a vulnerable population with extreme speed Because of the off-line nature of the spread map computation, flash worms are a useful thought experiment for exploring the worst case performance of containment defenses. The spread map can be adjusted to be whatever will be most difficult for the defense, and then the worm made as efficient as possible given that constraint. Flash worm is supposed to have the list of all the possible targets prepared in advance so that no scan during the worm spreading time is necessary. Creation of such a worm requires considerable preparation efforts. Thus, the whole Internet has to be scanned in some way and the list of best initial targets is constructed. While this preparation procedure is quite expensive it can easily be accomplished by a government scale organization by a brute force scanning via a fast Internet link. This method, however, has a big limitation. Hosts behind firewalls cannot be scanned effectively. Examples of such Flash worm are Stumble

1.Compiled virus These types of viruses that are compiled into machine executable instructions, so, that they are executed by the Operating System directly. In addition to infecting files, compiled viruses can reside in the memory of infected systems so that each time a new program is executed, the virus infects the program. The Compiled virus typically falls into two categories which are as follow; 
1 File infector virus  2.Boot sector virus   </p>
              <p>
2. File infector virus â€“  A file infector virus attaches itself to executable programs, such as word processors, spreadsheet applications, and computer games. When the virus has infected a program, it propagates to infect other programs on the system, as well as other systems that use a shared infected program. Once inserted, the malicious code basically 'hijacks' the operating system and subverts its usual behavior, forcing the computer to follow instructions from the virus. A virus that attacks the files on a computer is referred to as a file virus or file infector virus. File viruses number in the thousands, but are not the most widely found in the wild. File viruses have a wide variety of infection techniques and infect a large number of file types 
The most frequent file extensions are com, exe, ovl, bin, sys, bat, obj, prg, menu etc. In all cases, the file viruses act in a similar way. They most often rewrite the beginning of a file where they either write the jump command referring to themselves i.e. virus body, or store themselves to this place. The second case may concern so-called overwriting or destructive viruses. One of their drawbacks is that they destroy or damage the host program. When you try to execute it, the virus is activated, but the program itself is not able to run. We should subdivide file viruses according to the target of infection - they are typically executable files, because the virus's aim is to activate virus through executing host code and therefore the possibility of its spread. The file infector viruses are described in following way; i.e. FILE VIRUS, PROGRAM VIRUS, PARASITIC VIRUSES, BATCH FILE VIRUS, AND DIRECTORY [CLUSTER] VIRUSES  </p>
                   <p>
I) FILE VIRUSES - File viruses are designed to enter your system and infect program and data files. A file virus ordinarily enters the system when you copy data or start your system using an infected floppy disk or, downloads an infected file from a networked system or, use infected software obtained from unauthorized sources. Once in your system, depending upon the virus code, the virus can either infect other program or data files straightway or, it can choose to hide itself in the system memory (RAM) for the time being. Then, at an appropriate time or if certain system conditions are met, it begins to infect other executed program or data files. The virus infects a program or a data file by replacing part of the original file code with a new code. This new code is designed to pass the actual control of the file to the virus. The virus normally attaches itself to the end of the host file. On execution of an infected file by the user, the virus makes sure that the file is executed properly; to avoid suspicion. However, it uses this opportunity to infect other files. At the same time, the virus keeps tabs on the various system resources, so that at an appropriate time (depending upon the virus code), it can unleash its destructive activities. It is interesting to note that most viruses do not infect an already infected file. This is to prevent the file from becoming too large. Because then, the system would be compelled to display the message 'Not enough memory,' thus alerting the user to the possibility of a virus attack. The more sophisticated file viruses save (rather than overwrite) the original instructions when they insert their code into the program. This allows them to execute
the original program after the virus finishes so that everything appears normal. Some file viruses also infect overlay files as well as the more usual *.COM and *.EXE files. Overlay files have various extensions, but .OVR and .OVL are common. Files with the extension .DLL are also capable of being infected. Indeed, as operating systems become more advanced, typically more files become able to contain executable code and thus be vulnerable to infection. Examples of such virus are Vienna, Jerusalem, Concept Word Macro virus, Cascade etc.   </p>
              <p>
II) PROGRAM VIRUSES - Program files are those files which contain coded instructions, necessary to run or execute software programs. These program files are generally appended by .COM or .EXE file extensions. The program files, most prone to file virus attacks include operating software, spreadsheets, word processors, games and utilities program files. [15] These infect executable program files, such as those with extensions like .BIN, .COM, .EXE, .OVL, .DRV (driver) and .SYS (device driver). These programs are loaded in memory during execution, taking the virus with them. The virus becomes active in memory, making copies of it and infecting files on disk. Program viruses attach themselves to executable files such as .exe files. Each time you run the program, the virus duplicates itself and attaches to other programs. Sharing programs with other computers, either by disk or on a network, spreads these types of viruses.  Examples of such virus are Sunday, Cascade, Dec 12-15, Emirates Palace, UAE Register Early to Save  </p>
              <p>
III) PARASITIC VIRUSES â€“ These are pieces of code that attach themselves to executable Files, driver files or compressed files and are activated when the host program is run.  After activation, the virus may spread itself by attaching itself to other program in the system, and also carry out the malevolent activity it was programmed for. Most file viruses spread by loading themselves in system memory and looking for any other by loading themselves in system memory and looking for any other programs located on the drive if it finds one, it modifies the program so that it contains and activates the virus next times it runs .it keeps doing this repeatedly. It is also known as file viruses. 
 
 Besides spreading themselves, these viruses also carry some type of â€—triggerâ€˜. The trigger could be a specific date, or the number of times the viruses has been replicated, or anything equally trivial. Such viruses commonly infect additional programs as they are run, or even just as directory listings are made. But there are many non-resident viruses, too, which simply infect one or more files each time an infected file is run. Amongst traditional EXE and/or COM infectors, these nonresident viruses have not been very â€—successfulâ€˜ (in terms of prevalence of infection in the wild).  The operating system on your computer sees the virus as part of the program you were trying to run and gives it the same rights. These rights allow the virus to copy itself, install itself in memory or release its payload. These viruses Infects over networks [14] Examples of such virus are Jerusalem, CIH (Chernobyl), Remote Explorer, Mutant, BootExe, Win95.Murkry, and Lehigh   </p>
              <p>
IV) BATCH FILE VIRUS - This type of virus is embedded into an especially written batch file. The batch file in the guise of carrying out a set of instructions in a particular sequence actually uses the opportunity to copy the virus code to other batch files. Fortunately, such viruses are not common. Batch files can be used to transmit binary executable code and either be or drop viruses. To detect these viruses look for two signs: An odd label at the start of the batch file. And a batch file that is too long for the text in it.  There are several batch file viruses, but each works in a manner similar to that described above. The labels and batch file instructions may differ; but the method of operation is similar. Use the characteristics of the virus described above to look for batch file viruses. If there are obscure labels at the start of a batch file, use caution. Most batch file labels are fairly straight forward words or names. Secondly, if you see a batch file that is several thousand bytes long yet when you use the DOS command TYPE to display it to the screen you only see a few lines, that is another tip-off. Most batch file viruses insert an end-of-file mark (Control-Z) between the batch file portion and the binary instruction portion. Batch file viruses are not common; but like with all things new on your system, take care. [16] Examples of such virus are BAT-Parasite, the Wagner Virus, and The code  
              </p>
              <p>
V) DIRECTORY [CLUSTER] VIRUSES - As the name indicates, a directory virus functions by infecting the directory of your computer.  A directory is simply a larger file that contains information about other files and sub-directories within it.  The general information consists of the file or directory name, the starting cluster, attributes, date and time and so forth.  When a file is accessed, it scans the directory entry in search of the corresponding directory.   These viruses are also called as Cluster Viruses and are programmed to modify the directory table entries in an infected system. The virus, on entering your system, resides in the last cluster of the hard disk. Also, it modifies the starting cluster addresses of all the executable files, by inserting references to the virus address in the File Allocation Table (FAT). The files themselves are not infected, only their starting cluster addresses are altered, so that every time the file is executed, the virus also becomes active and loads into the system memory. The virus allows the actual program to proceed for the time being in order to avoid detection. Also, the virus, when loaded in memory, continues to show the original starting cluster address of the file, so as to confuse the user. Like other viruses, this type of a virus also disrupts the smooth working of your system. Directory viruses change the paths that indicate the location of a file. A directory virus inserts a malicious code into a cluster and marks it as allocated in the FAT. This prevents it from being allocated in the future. The virus then saves the first cluster and forces it to target other clusters, indicating each file it wants to infect.  Examples of such virus are Bulgarian virus, The BHP virus, DIR II, DIR III, DIR BYWAY These are dependent on the particular file type and platform as they are designed keeping in view the way these files execute. To infect a particular file, the virus program should be able to parse it, copy itself into the program and modify the header to get executed, whenever the program is executed. For this to happen, it needs to understand how the various executables are executed in the operating system. Accordingly, there are four (4) subtypes in this category. They are; i) Appending Virus     ii) Overwriting Virus     iii) Cavity Virus iv) Companion Viruses 

i) Appending Virus - This is a type of virus that attaches itself to the end of the host file and modifies the header of the host file so that the control shifts to it on execution. In an appending virus infection, the virus code is appended to the host program and the main entry point of the host program present in the program header is changed to point to the beginning of the virus code. So, when the program executes, the virus is executed first. Then at the end of the virus code, a jump or call routine takes the control back to the start of the host program. Also the new size of the infected host file is updated in the header accordingly.  Examples of such virus are Vienna, Stealth Warrior/The Alliance/SLAM  
ii) Overwriting viruses - Overwriting viruses were initially deployed because of their effectiveness; a way for the infection to infuse itself with an innocent file.  This corrupts the original file in such a way that it can't be disinfected.  Many of them are able to escape the scanner of an Anti-virus program, making no alterations to the victim file so changes aren't detected. While they were very effective, most malicious codes do not write this type of virus anymore. The viruses are very simple and direct in their actions. They overwrite the host program with their own code which devaluates it. That is why they are called overwriting viruses. When calling the host program the viruses need not to be installed to memory at all and they just overwrite some program on the disk by themselves. The program is chosen using some key that is specific for every virus. The program itself becomes worthless and calling it only activates the malefactor and then an error occurs. Examples of such virus are Way, Trj.Reboot, Trivial.88.D  
iii) Cavity Virus - A space fuller (cavity) virus attempts to install itself inside of the file it is infecting. This is difficult but has become easier with new file formats designed to make executable files load and run faster. Cavity virus is one which overwrites a part of the host file that is filled with a constant, without increasing the length of the file, but preserving its functionality.  Not always a virus has to write its body to the beginning or the end of an exe or com file. There are exceptions, fortunately not many, which inserts its body into host file cavities. According to our definition, they are not link viruses, because the infection does not cause file lengthening. Some program files have empty spaces inside them, for a variety of reasons. A Cavity virus uses this empty space to install itself inside the file, without in anyway altering the program itself. Since the 

length of the program is not increased, the virus does not need to employ complex deception techniques. However such viruses are rare. A space filler (cavity) virus, on the other hand, attempts to be clever. Some program files, for a variety of reasons, have empty space inside of them. This empty space can be used to house virus code. Because of the difficulty of writing this type of virus and the limited number of possible hosts, cavity viruses are rare. A cavity virus attempts to install itself inside of the file it is infecting. This is difficult to do properly and so this type of virus is rare. Examples of such virus are The Lehigh virus, CIH virus, or Chernobyl Virus  
iv) Companion Viruses â€“ These viruses create a new file with a different extension, which is composed of the original file and the appended virus. The name of this virus comes from the fact that the virus accompanies the infected file with a companion file. The virus can be given name for example file.com. Every time the user executes file.exe; operating system loads file.com first and therefore infects the system. Although companion viruses do not rank among the most popular viruses, they represent however a real challenge as far as antiviral protection is concerned. Indeed, this infection mode is quite different from the three abovementioned modes. In this mode, the target code is not modified, thus pre serving the code integrity. There in lies the great interest of this infection mode. The viral code identifies a target program and duplicates its own virus code, but instead of inserting its code in the target code, it creates an additional file, which is somehow linked to the target code as far as execution is concerned. Whenever the user executes a target program which has been infected by this type of virus, the viral copy contained in the additional file is executed first, thus enabling the virus to spread using the same mechanism. Then, the virus calls the original, legitimate target program which is then executed.[14] Examples of such virus are Stator, Asimov.1539, and Terrax.1069</p>
              <p>
2.Boot sector Viruses-  Boot sector viruses infect the executable code stored in certain parts of system region on the disk. It can concern floppy disk boot sectors, hard disk partition table or hard disk boot sector. The sector is where your computer starts reading your operating system. This is a crucial part of a disk, in which information on the disk itself is stored together with a program that makes it possible to start the computer from the disk. One important trick was the ability to load viruses into memory so they could  
keep running in the background as long as the computer remained on. This gave viruses a much more effective way to replicate themselves. Another trick was the ability to infect the boot sector on floppy disks and hard disks. The boot sector is a small program that is the first part of the operating system that the computer loads. The boot sector contains a tiny program that tells the computer how to load the rest of the operating system. By putting its code in the boot sector, a virus can guarantee it gets executed. [15] Boot sector exists on every floppy disk that has been formatted using MSDOS, no matter if this floppy disk is a system disk or data disk. Boot sector contains a short program that uses DOS for executing the system before passing control to other system programs or command compiler. There are very important instructions in the boot sectors that load operating system to the main memory on every startup, therefore it is enough if the virus or its activating mechanism is stored in this sector, and the virus will be loaded to main memory with every boot up. Mentioned viruses usually rewrite the boot sector with their own code and the original parts of the boot sector save on different part of disk. The infection then spreads using floppy disk boot sectors that got in touch with the infected system and that the resident boot virus replicates into immediately. The spread of boot sector viruses in 32bit systems is much more difficult than in DOS because a boot sector virus is detected right away on the system boot. Infects the boot sector or the master boot record, or displaces the active boot sector, of a hard drive. Once the hard drive is booted up, boot sector viruses load them selves into the computerâ€˜s memory [15].   In effect, the virus takes full control of the infected computer. A boot sector virus, like other viruses, enters the system when you copy data or start your system using an infected floppy disk or, downloads an infected file from a networked system or, use infected software obtained from unauthorized sources. This is true even of disks that do not hold a bootable operating system. This boot sector is the very first sector of the logical drive and contains specific information relating to the formatting of the disk, the data stored there and on PCs is expected to contain a small program called the boot program. Boot programs are expected to load the appropriate operating system files when an attempt is made to boot from a disk, and typically display the familiar "Non-system Disk or Disk Error" message if the operating system files are not present. It is increasingly common for the boot program on diskettes to simply display a message warning that the diskette does not contain a bootable system â€“ such boot programs will be overwritten with an 

appropriate one should you reformat the diskette using an option that copies operating system files to the disk.  Examples of such virus are Polyboot.B, AntiEXE, Joshi and Michelangelo, Form, Disk Killer, and Stone virus  
                  </p>
                  <p>
3.Interpreted virus An interpreted virus is composed of source code that can be executed only by a particular application or service. Interpreted viruses have become very common because they are much easier to write and modify than other types of viruses. The viruses are classified in to two main categories which are as follow; i. Macro Virus ii. Script Virus i. Macro Virus  A macro virus is a virus that attaches itself to a spreadsheet worksheet, or is programmed into the spreadsheet. Written in the macro scripting languages of word processing, accounting, editing, or project applications, it propagates by exploiting the macro languageâ€˜s properties in order to transfer itself from the infected file containing the macro script to another file. The most widespread macro viruses are for Microsoft Office applications like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Access. Because they are written in the code of application Software, macro viruses are platform independent and can spread between Mac, Windows, Linux, and any other system running the targeted application. [16] These mini-programs make it possible to automate series of operations so that they are performed as a single action, thereby saving the user from having to carry them out one by one. In addition, when a macro virus infection occurs, the virus infects the template that the program uses to create and open files. Once a template is infected, every document that is created or opened with that template is also infected. Any document on that machine that uses the same application can then become infected. If the infected computer is on a network, the infection is likely to spread rapidly to other machines on the network. Moreover, if a copy of an infected file is passed to anyone else i.e. by email or floppy disk, the virus can spread to the recipientâ€˜s computer. This process of infection will end only when the virus is noticed and all viral macros are eradicated. 

The most popular and most widespread macro language is VBA and this is very easy to write programs in, be they viruses or not. This is, of course, part of the reason why VBA viruses became very common â€“ many people who could not otherwise write a virus have been able to write a VBA macro virus. This also adds to its threat as a virus development platform because the term â€—application macroâ€˜ suggests to many users and administrators the keystroke recording type of â€—macroâ€˜ common in earlier and less powerful applications. If â€—macroâ€˜ means â€—keystroke recordingâ€˜ to someone, they are unlikely to imagine much of a threat being possible in a â€—macro virusâ€˜.  Examples of such virus are DMV, Nuclear, Word Concept, WM/Wazzu, OF97/Crown-B, Corel Script, CSC/CSV.A, Relax, Melissa.A and Bablas. Pc, W97M.Melissa, WM.NiceDay, W97M.Groov .EXE or .VBS   
ii. Scripting viruses   Scripting viruses are a subset of file viruses, written in one of a variety of script languages (Visual Basic Script, JavaScript, Windows Batch, etc.). Either infects other scripts, e.g., Windows command and service files, or forms a part of a multi-component virus. Script viruses are able to infect other file formats, such as Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), if that file format allows the execution of scripts. These are very similar to macro viruses. The primary difference is that a macro virus is written in a language understood by a particular application, such as a word processor, whereas a scripting virus is written in a language understood by a service run by the OS. [16]  Viruses that infect various scripting languages, from the most basic (DOS batch) through to the sophisticated JavaScript (JS) and Visual Basic Script (VBS), are also a form of file infector. DOS batch viruses have always been of interest value only, never posing a serious threat due to the rather limited nature of the language itself. However, the increased complexity of the JS and VBS languages hosted under the Windows Scripting Host (WSH) certainly increased the attractiveness of script file infectors. The integration of the scripting engine with many standard OS functions such as file system, networking and registry interfaces opened up a whole slew of opportunities â€“ much like VBA macro viruses, these scripting languages have allowed â€—non-programmersâ€˜ to become virus writers.  

Examples of such virus are JS.Fortnight, Browser exploit, Spoon, Samy Worm, XSS Viruses, JS.Fortnight  </p>
              <p>
4.Multipartite viruses  Multipartite viruses are distributed through infected media and usually hide in the memory. Multipartite viruses affect executable files, disk boot sectors and sometimes also floppy disks sectors. Their name comes from the fact that they do not restrict to any specific disk region or any specific file type, but infect computers in several ways. If you execute any application affected by the multipartite virus, the virus infects the boot sector of your machine. The virus is activated on the next system load and infects any suitable program that you execute. Before the rise of macro viruses, several of the most common file infectors were actually the file infector parts of multi-partite viruses that had leveraged the distribution advantage attributable to their boot infector components. These viruses became common because of their boot virus components. More recently we have seen complex forms of multi-parties with, for example, viruses that infect EXE files and insert droppers as macros in suitable document files.  These is no difference between multipartite virus and non multipartite virus, Because all parts of these viruses depend on the Visual Basic for Applications macro platform, these viruses are usually not considered as infecting more than one target type. Such viruses are sometimes referred to as cross-platform viruses, but that is also contentious as the platform is essentially the same. Such viruses that work â€—betweenâ€˜ office applications are often called cross-infectors or crossapplication-infectors which are a suitable term. Multi-partite viruses are rare, although in the past the file infectors most commonly seen in the wild were the file infecting components of file and boot multi-parties. Examples of such virus are Natas, Invader, Flip, and Tequila, Invader, Flip, and Tequila, Ywinz </p>
              <p>
5.Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) virus The RFID worm infection process begins when hackers first discover RFID middleware servers to infect over the Internet. An RFID worm propagates by exploiting security flaws in online RFID services. RFID worms do not necessarily require users to do anything to propagate, although they will also happily spread via 
 
RFID tags. A type of theoretical virus that is expected to target RFID devices. So far, such viruses have only been demonstrated by researchers. A completely different category of threats arises when hackers or criminals cause valid RFID tags to behave in unexpected ways. Typically, computer-bound or mobile RFID readers query RFID tags for their unique identifier or on-tag data, which often serves as a database key or launches some real-world activity.  Everyone working on RFID technology has tacitly assumed that the mere act of scanning an RFID tag cannot modify back-end software, and certainly not in a malicious way. An RFID tag can be intentionally infected with a virus and this virus can infect the backend database used by the RFID software. From there it can be easily spread to other RFID tags. No one thought this possible until now. Later in this website we provide all the details on how to do this and how to defend against it in order to warn the designers of RFID systems not to deploy vulnerable systems. 
              Examples of such virus are SQL Injector etc

                  HISTORIES OF WORST COMPUTER VIRUS ATTACKS:
                  
                  
                  <p>
                  Virus attacks are not shocking news anymore. But here is the list of the worst of those attacks which shocked many at that time in history. The history of computer virus attack is as follow;
                          </p>
                  
                  
                   <p>
                  [1] Jerusalem [1998] - This was the first MS-DOS virus that caused enormous destructions, affecting many countries, universities and company worldwide. On Friday 13, 1988 the computer virus managed to infect a number of institutions in Europe, America and the Middle East.
                               </p>
                  
  <p>                 
[2] Morris [1998] - This computer virus infected over 6,000 computer systems in the United States, including the famous NASA research Institute, which for some time remained completely paralyzed. Due to erratic code, the worm managed to send millions of copies of itself to different network computers, being able to entirely 
 
paralyze all network resources. The damages caused by the Morris computer virus were estimated at $96 million [18].
              </p>
      
      
      
      
 <p>
[3] Solar Sunrise [1998] â€“ In 1998 using a computer virus,  hackers, , penetrated and took control of over 500 computers systems that belonged to the army, government and private sector of the United States. The whole situation was dubbed Solar Sunrise after the popular vulnerabilities in computers that run on the operating system called Sun Solaris. It was later allow showing that the incidents represented the work of two American teenagers from California. After the attacks, the Defense Department took drastic actions to prevent future incidents of this kind [27].  
             </p>
      <p>
[4] CIH [1998] - Unleashed from Taiwan in June of 1998, CIH is recognized as one of the most dangerous and destructive virus ever. The virus infected Windows 95, 98, and ME executable files and was able to remain resident in a PCâ€˜s memory, where it continued to infect other executables. What made CIH so dangerous is that, shortly after activated, it would overwrite data on the host PCâ€˜s hard drive. It was also capable of overwriting the BIOS of the host, preventing boot-up. Because it infected executable files, CIH wound up being distributed by numerous software distributors.[28]
                  </p>
          
           <p>
[5] Melissa [1999] - It was created by David L. Smith in 1999 and is based on a Microsoft Word macro. He intended to spread the virus through e-mail messages. The virus prompts the recipient to open a document and by doing so the virus gets activated. The activated virus replicates itself and will be transferred to 50 persons whose address is present in the recipientâ€˜s e-mail address book. The increase in e-mail traffic due to the virus forced some companies to block e-mail a program until the virus attack was controlled.[13]         </p>
               
                <p>
[6] ILOVEYOUILOVEYOU [2000] - It was a standalone program which was capable of replicating itself. The virus initially traveled through the e-mail, same way as Melissa virus. The email had a subject which says that the message was a love letter from the secret admirer. Attachment with this e-mail caused all the trouble. The file LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs contained the worm. As the name suggests Visual Basic Scripting was used for creating this virus. The copied itself several times

and made victimâ€˜s several folders hidden, it added several new files to the victimâ€˜s computer registry keys and replaced several files with copies of itself.[28]         </p> 
                    
                     <p>
[7] Code Red and Code Red II [2001] â€“ It was exploited operating system vulnerability found in Windows 2000 and Windows NT machines. A buffer overflow problem was the vulnerability. Due to this if the operating system receives more information than its buffers handling capacity; the adjacent memory will be overwritten. The original worm initiated a distributed denial of service attack to the White House website. That means all the infected computers with Code Red try to contact the Web servers at the same time, thereby overloading the machines. The infected machine no longer obeys the owner, allowing a remote user to control and access the machine.[11]         </p> 
                          <p>
[8] Nimda [2001] - It was spread through the Internet rapidly and became one of the fastest propagating computer virus. The Nimda worms aimed on the Internet servers and its real purpose was to slow down the Internet traffic. Nimda could travel through the Internet in multiple methods which included the email. The Nimda worm was able to create a backdoor into the victimâ€˜s OS. If the victim was logged in as the administrator for the machine, then the worm would provide the attacker the full control over the system. The Nimda virus caused several network systems to crash as the systemâ€˜s resources were taken away by the worm. The Nimda worm was one of the dreaded distributed denials of service (DDoS) attack virus.[30]          </p>
                               <p>
[9] The Klez Virus [2001] â€“ It was appeared in late 2001 and infected a victimâ€˜s computer through an e-mail message. The virus replicated itself and was sent itself to all the contacts in the victimâ€˜s address book. The virus could disable virus-scanning software and could falsely act as a virus-removal tool. The modified version of this virus could take any name from the contact list of the victim and can place that address in the â€•Fromâ€– field. This technique is called spoofing. By spoofing the e-mail appears to come from a source when itâ€˜s actually coming from somewhere else. Spoofing will prevent the userâ€˜s chance to block email from a suspected recipient.[27]         </p> 
                                    <p>
[10] SQL Slammer / Sapphire SQL [2003] â€“ It caused a damage of affected networks included Bank of Americaâ€˜s ATM service, Continental Airlines etc. A few 
    
 minutes after the infection of the first Internet server, the number of victims of the Slammer virus doubled every few seconds. After Fifteen minutes of the first attack, half of the servers that act as the pillars of the Internet were affected by the virus.[14]          </p>
                                         <p>
[11] Sasser and Netsky [2003] - The Sasser worm exploited Microsoft Windows vulnerability. The infected system will look for other vulnerable systems and instruct those systems to download the virus. A random scan of the IP addresses was done to find potential victims. The virus made it difficult to shut down the computer without turning OFF the system. The Netsky virus spread through e-mail and Windows networks. The virus causes a denial of service (DoS) attack on the affected system.[14]        </p>
                                              <p>
[12] Blaster [2003] â€“ The summer of 2003 was a rough time for businesses running PCs. Blaster, also known as Lovsan or MSBlast, was the first to hit. The virus was spread rapidly, peaking in just two days. Transmitted via network and Internet traffic, this worm exploited vulnerability in Windows 2000 and Windows XP, and when activated, presented the PC user with a menacing dialog box indicating that a system shutdown was imminent. Hidden in the code of MSBLAST.EXE â€” the virusâ€˜ executableâ€– were these messages: â€•I just want to say LOVE YOU SAN!!â€– and â€•billy gates why you make this possible? Stop making money and fix your software!!â€–[15]         </p> 
                                                  
                                                   <p>
[13] Sobig.F [2003] â€“ The Sobig worm hit right on the heels of Blaster, making August 2003 a miserable month for corporate and home PC users. The most destructive variant was Sobig.F, which spread so rapidly that it set a record, generating over 1 million copies of itself in its first 24 hours. The virus infected host computers via innocuously named e-mail attachments such as application. When activated, this worm transmitted itself to e-mail addresses discovered on a host of local file types. The end result was massive amounts of Internet traffic.[11]          </p>
                                                   <p>
[14] Bagle [2004] â€“ Bagle, a classic but sophisticated worm, made its debut on January 18, 2004. The malicious code infected usersâ€˜ systems via the traditional mechanism â€” an e-mail attachment â€” and then scoured Windows files for e-mail addresses it could use to replicate itself. The real danger of Bagle (a.k.a. Beagle) and its 60 to 100 variants is that, when the worm infects a PC, it opens a back door to a TCP port that can be used by remote users and applications to access data â€”financial, personal, anything â€” on the infected system. According to an April 2005 TechWeb story, the worm is â€•usually credited with starting the malware-for-profit movement among hackers, who prior to the ground-breaking worm, typically were motivated by notoriety.â€– The Bagle.B variant was designed to stop spreading after January 28, 2004, but numerous other variants of the virus continue to plague users to this day.[28]          </p>
     <p>
[15] Sasser [2004] - Sasser began spreading on April 30, 2004, and was destructive enough to shut down the satellite communications for some French news agencies. It also resulted in the cancellation of several Delta airline flights and the shutdown of numerous companiesâ€˜ systems worldwide. Unlike most previous worms, Sasser was not transmitted via e-mail and required no user interaction to spread. Instead the worm exploited a security flaw in non-updated Windows 2000 and Windows XP systems. When successfully replicated, the worm would actively scan for other unprotected systems and transmit itself to them. Infected systems experienced repeated crashes and instability.[28]          </p>
         
          <p>
[16] Leap-A/Oompa-A [2004] - Oompa-A was one of the viruses which aimed at Mac systems. The viruses used the iChat instant messaging program for its propagation among vulnerable Mac computers. The Leap-A virus was not able to cause much harm to computers, but showed that even a Mac computer can be affected by malicious software. [16]          </p>
              
               <p>
[17] Storm Worm [2004] - The Storm Worm got this particular name because of the fact that the e-mail messages which carry the virus carried a subject â€•230 dead as storm batters Europe.â€– Some versions of this Worm turn computers into bots or Zombies. The infected computers become vulnerable to further attack by the person behind the attack. [14]        </p>
                    <p>
[18] MyDoom [2004] - It was creates a backdoor in the OS of the victimâ€˜s computer. The MyDoom virus had two triggers. One of them began a denial of service (DoS) attack on Feb. 1, 2004. In Feb. 12, 2004 the second trigger was initiated which stopped the virus distributing itself. Later that year, MyDoom virus outbreak occurred for a second time, which targeted several search engine companies. The 

 33 
virus would send a search request to a search engine and will use e-mail addresses obtained in the search results. Such a type of attack slowed down search engine services and caused some website crash. [15]          </p>
                        
                         <p>
                                  [19] Downadup [2009]â€“The latest and most dangerous virus is the â€œdownadupâ€� worm, which was also called â€œConfickerâ€�. The computer security company F-Secure stated that the computer virus has infected 3.5 million computers worldwide. This malicious program was able to spread using a patched Windows flaw. Downadup was successful in spreading across the Web due to the fact that it used a flaw that Microsoft patched in October in order to distantly compromise computers that ran unmatched versions of Microsoftâ€˜s operating system. But the greatest power of the worm is believed to be the ability of computers, infected with the worm, to download destructive code from a random drop point. F-Secure stated that three of the most affected countries were China, Brazil and Russia.  </p> </div>

      Antivirus software is a class of program designed to prevent, detect and remove malware infections on individual computing devices, networks and IT systems.

Antivirus software, originally designed to detect and remove viruses from computers, can also protect against a wide variety of threats, including other types of malicious software, such as  keyloggers, browser hijackers, Trojan horses, worms, rootkits, spyware, adware, botnets and ransomware.

How antivirus software works
Antivirus software typically runs as a background process, scanning computers, servers or mobile devices to detect and restrict the spread of malware. Many antivirus software programs include real-time threat detection and protection to guard against potential vulnerabilities as they happen, as well as system scans that monitor device and system files looking for possible risks.

Antivirus software usually performs these basic functions:

Scanning directories or specific files for known malicious patterns indicating the presence of malicious software;
Allowing users to schedule scans so they run automatically;
Allowing users to initiate new scans at any time; and
Removing any malicious software it detects. Some antivirus software programs do this automatically in the background, while others notify users of infections and ask them if they want to clean the files.
In order to scan systems comprehensively, antivirus software must generally be given privileged access to the entire system. This makes antivirus software itself a common target for attackers, and researchers have discovered remote code execution and other serious vulnerabilities in antivirus software products in recent years.

Types of antivirus programs
Antivirus software is distributed in a number of forms, including stand-alone antivirus scanners and internet security suites that offer antivirus protection, along with firewalls, privacy controls and other security protections.

Some antivirus software vendors offer basic versions of their products at no charge. These free versions generally offer basic antivirus and spyware protection, but more advanced features and protections are usually available only to paying customers.

While some operating systems are targeted more frequently by virus developers, antivirus software is available for most OSes:

Windows antivirus software. Most antivirus software vendors offer several levels of Windows products at different price points, starting with free versions offering only basic protection. Users must start scans and updates manually and typically free versions of antivirus software won't protect against links to malicious websites or malicious attachments in emails. Premium versions of antivirus software often include suites of endpoint security tools that may provide secure online storage, ad blockers and file encryption. Since 2004, Microsoft has been offering some kind of free antivirus software as part of the Windows operating system itself, generally under the name Windows Defender, though the software was mostly limited to detecting spyware prior to 2006.
macOS antivirus software. Although macOS viruses exist, they're less common than Windows viruses, so antivirus products for macOS are less standardized than those for Windows. There are a number of free and paid products  available, providing  on-demand tools to protect against potential malware threats through full-system malware scans and the ability to sift through specific email threads, attachments and various web activities.
Android antivirus software. Android is the world's most popular mobile operating system and is installed on more mobile devices than any other OS. Because most mobile malware targets Android, experts recommend all Android device users install antivirus software on their devices. Vendors offer a variety of basic free and paid premium versions of their Android antivirus software including anti-theft and remote-locating features. Some run automatic scans and actively try to stop malicious web pages and files from being opened or downloaded.
Virus detection techniques
Antivirus software uses a variety of virus detection techniques.

Originally, antivirus software depended on signature-based detection to flag malicious software. Antivirus programs depend on stored virus signatures -- unique strings of data that are characteristic of known malware. The antivirus software uses these signatures to identify when it encounters viruses that have already been identified and analyzed by security experts.


Signature-based malware cannot detect new malware, including variants of existing malware. Signature-based detection can only detect new viruses when the definition file is updated with information about the new virus. With the number of new malware signatures increasing at around 10 million per year as long ago as 2011, modern signature databases may contain hundreds of millions, or even billions, of entries, making antivirus software based solely on signatures impractical. However, signature-based detection does not usually produce false positive matches.

Heuristic-based detection uses an algorithm to compare the signatures of known viruses against potential threats. With heuristic-based detection, antivirus software can detect viruses that haven't been discovered yet, as well as already existing viruses that have been disguised or modified and released as new viruses. However, this method can also generate false-positive matches when antivirus software detects a program behaving similarly to a malicious program and incorrectly identifies it as a virus.

Antivirus software may also use behavior-based detection to analyze an object's behavior or potential behavior for suspicious activities and infers malicious intent based on those observations. For example, code that attempts to perform unauthorized or abnormal actions would indicate the object is malicious, or at least suspicious. Some examples of behaviors that potentially signal danger include modifying or deleting large numbers of files, monitoring keystrokes, changing settings of other programs and remotely connecting to computers

  </div>
    <div id="trojanhorse div" style="display:none;">A Trojan horse or Trojan is a type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software. Trojans can be employed by cyber-thieves and hackers trying to gain access to users' systems. Users are typically tricked by some form of social engineering into loading and executing Trojans on their systems. Once activated, Trojans can enable cyber-criminals to spy on you, steal your sensitive data, and gain backdoor access to your system. These actions can include:

Deleting data
Blocking data
Modifying data
Copying data
Disrupting the performance of computers or computer networks
Unlike computer viruses and worms, Trojans are not able to self-replicate.

How Trojans can impact you
Trojans are classified according to the type of actions that they can perform on your computer:



Backdoor  
A backdoor Trojan gives malicious users remote control over the infected computer. They enable the author to do anything they wish on the infected computer – including sending, receiving, launching and deleting files, displaying data and rebooting the computer. Backdoor Trojans are often used to unite a group of victim computers to form a botnet or zombie network that can be used for criminal purposes.

Exploit  
Exploits are programs that contain data or code that takes advantage of a vulnerability within application software that’s running on your computer.

Rootkit  
Rootkits are designed to conceal certain objects or activities in your system. Often their main purpose is to prevent malicious programs being detected – in order to extend the period in which programs can run on an infected computer.

Trojan-Banker  
Trojan-Banker programs are designed to steal your account data for online banking systems, e-payment systems and credit or debit cards.

Trojan-DDoS  
These programs conduct DoS (Denial of Service) attacks against a targeted web address. By sending multiple requests – from your computer and several other infected computers – the attack can overwhelm the target address… leading to a denial of service.

Trojan-Downloader  
Trojan-Downloaders can download and install new versions of malicious programs onto your computer – including Trojans and adware.

Trojan-Dropper  
These programs are used by hackers in order to install Trojans and / or viruses – or to prevent the detection of malicious programs. Not all antivirus programs are capable of scanning all of the components inside this type of Trojan.

Trojan-FakeAV  
Trojan-FakeAV programs simulate the activity of antivirus software. They are designed to extort money from you – in return for the detection and removal of threats… even though the threats that they report are actually non-existent.

Trojan-GameThief  
This type of program steals user account information from online gamers.

Trojan-IM  
Trojan-IM programs steal your logins and passwords for instant messaging programs – such as ICQ, MSN Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo Pager, Skype and many more.

Trojan-Ransom  
This type of Trojan can modify data on your computer – so that your computer doesn’t run correctly or you can no longer use specific data. The criminal will only restore your computer’s performance or unblock your data, after you have paid them the ransom money that they demand.

Trojan-SMS  
These programs can cost you money – by sending text messages from your mobile device to premium rate phone numbers.

Trojan-Spy  
Trojan-Spy programs can spy on how you’re using your computer – for example, by tracking the data you enter via your keyboard, taking screen shots or getting a list of running applications.

Trojan-Mailfinder  
These programs can harvest email addresses from your computer.

Other types of Trojans include:

Trojan-ArcBomb

Trojan-Clicker

Trojan-Notifier

Trojan-Proxy

Trojan-PSW 

How to protect yourself against Trojans
By installing effective anti-malware software, you can defend your devices – including PCs, laptops, Macs, tablets and smartphones – against Trojans. A rigorous anti-malware solution – such as Kaspersky Anti-Virus – will detect and prevent Trojan attacks on your PC, while Kaspersky Mobile Security can deliver world-class virus protection for Android smartphones. Kaspersky Lab has anti-malware products that defend the following devices against Trojans:

Windows PCs
